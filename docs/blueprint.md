## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant magenta (#E040FB), inspired by the SparkLab logo, evoking creativity and energy.
- Background color: Dark navy (#1A237E), a desaturated version of the primary color, providing a sophisticated and modern backdrop, reminiscent of Jetbrains themes.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#3D5AFE), an analogous color to the primary, creating a high-contrast, visually striking experience akin to Apple's design aesthetics.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use minimalist, glowing icons that complement the color scheme. Icons should represent different aspects of the designathon and club activities.
- Use a clean, full-screen layout with a prominent 3D spark element. Sections should flow smoothly with ample spacing.
- Subtle animations and transitions throughout the site to enhance the user experience, inspired by modern web design trends, especially on the 3D spark interaction and countdown timer.
